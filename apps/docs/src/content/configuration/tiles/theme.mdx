# Theme

Theme Switcher Tile. Use `type = "logo"` to use this tile.

## Properties

This tile has the following defaults properties

| Property    | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| `col_start` | `-1`  |
| `row_start` | `-1`  |

You can override these properties, but the defaults look good in my opinion.

## Usage

```toml
[[tiles]]
type = "theme"
```
