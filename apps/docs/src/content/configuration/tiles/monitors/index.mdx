Monitors are probably the tiles you will use the most.

## Common Properties

All monitors have the following common properties that you can set:

| Property     | Type   | Description                                                                                         | Required |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `key`        | string | Key to indentify this monitor in the database.                                                      | Yes      |
| `name`       | string | Name of the monitor.                                                                                | No       |
| `short_name` | string | Short name of the monitor. Used when the tile size is 1x1                                           | No       |
| `icon`       | string | Icon to use for the monitor. This icon is used when tile is `1x1` size and `short_name` is not set. | No       |

**Notes**:

> `key` must be unique on a per monitor type basis.

> If `name` is not set, the `key` will be used as the monitor name.

> If `short_name` and `icon` are not set, first letter of the `name` will be used as the icon.
